This is a Rust library for manipulating file formats used with Texas
Instruments graphing calculators, primarily (for now?) those used with
the TI-83+ family. Both reading data from and writing data to files is
supported.

Supported file formats include:
 * Programs (8xp)
 * Application variables (AppVars, 8xv)
 * Pictures (8xi)

No particular improvements are planned for the future, though suggestions
are welcome; existing development has occurred as needed for my own
applications.
